Skeletons and Tests - Programming Mobile Applications for Android Handheld Systems


1 Lab - Development Environment : Instructions
Help Center

In this UNGRADED Lab you will experiment with the Android Development Environment. Note that since it's ungraded, the assignment's maximum score is 0.

You will set up your IDE and use it to create, run and debug Android applications.

Important Note: Remember that the students in this class have a wide range of previous experience and varying degrees of familiarity with Java, Eclipse and Android. If you are unfamiliar with these technologies, you may not be able to finish the entire Lab. If, however, you're experienced and already have your Android Development Environment set up, then skip over what you already know and try to get through the rest of the Lab. Because of this, I’m not expecting everyone to finish the entire Lab.

Instructions:

    Download the full lab writeup from the DevelopmentEnvironment folder in the course's Github repo.
    Once you've finished working on the Lab, please create a one-line text file, containing the following string, without the quotes: "Time Worked: XXX minutes." Replace "XXX" with the number of minutes you worked on the Lab (just an estimate is fine). Make sure you are creating a real text file, not, for example a .rtf file

Suggested Time:

1-2 hours. See what you can get done in this time frame. Take a break in the middle, returning later if you need to. Don’t feel that you need to finish everything in this lab. That’s not the goal here.

Specifically, if you are fairly new to programming, you should try to complete Parts 1 – 4. If you are more familiar with programming and programming environments, you may be able to do the whole thing. It's really up to you.

Enjoy!

2 Lab - The Activity Class: Instructions
Help Center

In this Lab you will experiment with the Activity Class.

You will create a simple application that monitors itself and reports its behavior by emitting LogCat messages and printing information to the screen. After completing the lab you should better understand the Activity class, the Activity lifecycle, and the Android reconfiguration process.

Download the full lab writeup and source code files from the TheActivityClass folder in the course's Github repo. Inside you will find the Lab writeup. Please read it carefully before starting. You will also find the source files the project and test cases. Import them into your IDE.

3 Lab - Intents, Permissions and Fragments: Instructions
Help Center

This week's work involves three Labs: the IntentsLab, the PermissionsLab and the FragmentsLab.

In the IntentsLab you will experiment with Intents. You will create simple applications that create and use both explicit and implicit Intents to activate Activities. After completing the Lab you should better understand how Intents are used to identify, find and start Activities and how they are used to transfer data between Activities.

Download the full lab writeup and source code files from the Intents folder in the course's Github repo.

In the PermissionsLab you will experiment with Android's Permissions architecture. You will create simple applications that use, define and enforce Android Permissions. After completing the lab you should better understand how permissions are used to control access to particular application components.

Download the full lab writeup and source code files from the Permissions folder in the course's Github repo.

In the FragmentsLab you will experiment with the Fragment Class. You will create a simple application that uses Fragments to produce either a multi-pane or single-pane user interface depending on the current device’s screen size. After completing this lab you should better understand the Fragment class and its lifecycle, and how Fragments interact with the Activities that host them.

Download the full lab writeup and source code files from the Fragments folder in the course's Github repo.

Please remember to read the Lab writeups carefully to understand the Labs' requirements and testing procedures.

4 Lab - User Interface Classes: Instructions
Help Center

In this lab you will experiment with the Android user interface classes.

You will create a simple application that creates and displays To Do items. After completing this lab you should better understand how Android user interface classes can be combined and used to create complex and functional user interfaces.

Download the full lab writeup and source code files from the UserInterface folder in the course's Github repo.

Please remember to read the Lab writeup carefully to understand the Lab's requirements and testing procedures. 

Fill in the code that is missing from the Skeleton in accordance with the instructions given in the Lab writeup. The areas that you need to fill in are indicated by a comment containing the word: "TODO."

After you have finished the programming part of the assignment, follow the steps described in the writeup so we can evaluate your work.
